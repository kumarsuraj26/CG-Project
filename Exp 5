Sure! This code you've shared is used to draw a pixel-based shape using the graphics.h library in Turbo C. I'll guide you through the corrected code, and explain each part step by step.

### Corrected Code:

c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
#include<graphics.h>

void main()
{
    int gd = DETECT, gm, i, j;
    int a[10][20] = {
        {0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0},
        {0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0},
        {0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},
        {1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
        {1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
        {1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0},
        {1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0},
        {0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0},
        {0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0},
        {0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0}
    };

    // Initialize the graphics mode
    initgraph(&gd, &gm, "C:\\TURBOC3\\BGI");

    // Loop through the matrix and draw pixels where 1 is found
    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) // Modified loop limit for rows
    {
        for(j = 0; j < 20; j++) // Correct loop for columns
        {
            if(a[i][j] == 1)
                putpixel(100 + j, 200 + i, WHITE);
        }
    }

    getch(); // Wait for a key press
    closegraph(); // Close the graphics mode
}


### Explanation:

1. *Header Files:*
   - #include <stdio.h>: Provides standard input and output functions like printf, scanf.
   - #include <conio.h>: Used for console input/output functions such as getch() and clrscr(). getch() waits for a key press.
   - #include <graphics.h>: This is the main header for graphics functions in Turbo C. It allows you to draw shapes, pixels, and manipulate colors on the screen.

2. **Matrix Representation (a[10][20]):**
   - This 2D array (or matrix) contains `0`s and `1`s, which acts as a blueprint for drawing the image.
   - Each 1 in the array corresponds to a pixel that will be plotted on the screen.

3. *Graphics Initialization:*
   - int gd = DETECT, gm;: gd and gm are variables that store the graphics driver and mode. DETECT is a macro that tells Turbo C to automatically detect the graphics driver.
   - initgraph(&gd, &gm, "C:\\TURBOC3\\BGI");: Initializes the graphics mode. You must specify the path where your BGI (Borland Graphics Interface) drivers are located. For Turbo C, the default location is "C:\\TURBOC3\\BGI".

4. *Drawing the Shape:*
   - putpixel(100 + j, 200 + i, WHITE);: This function draws a pixel on the screen. It places a pixel at position (100 + j, 200 + i) with the color WHITE. 
     - 100 + j: Shifts the column to start at x = 100 on the screen.
     - 200 + i: Shifts the row to start at y = 200 on the screen.
     - WHITE: Specifies the color of the pixel.

5. *Looping Over the Matrix:*
   - The program iterates through the 2D array a[10][20] using two for loops. Wherever there is a 1 in the matrix, it draws a white pixel on the screen.

6. *End of Program:*
   - getch();: Pauses the program and waits for a key press before closing the graphics mode. This is essential in Turbo C graphics programs to view the output before the window closes.
   - closegraph();: Closes the graphics mode and returns control to the text mode.

### How to Run:
1. Open Turbo C IDE.
2. Copy the corrected code into a new C file.
3. Make sure that your Turbo C has the BGI drivers in C:\\TURBOC3\\BGI.
4. Compile and run the program.

This code should now work perfectly in Turbo C to display the pixel-based shape on your screen! Let me know if you need more help with Turbo C or this code.
